# AOCS Challenge Leaderboard

The **AOCS Challenge Leaderboard** is a web application that hosted a competition focused on developing control algorithms for an **Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS)**. Participants were tasked with designing controllers to stabilize an unstable satellite system in space. The competition evaluated the effectiveness of these control strategies in a simulated environment, with the top-performing algorithm tested in the **[Orbital Robotics Lab](https://www.esa.int/Education/ESA_Academy_Experiments_programme/Orbital_Robotics_Lab)** at the **European Space Agency (ESA), Netherlands**.

## Features

- **Competition Hub** – Provides all necessary information about the challenge.
- **Algorithm Submission** – Participants submit a `pickle` file containing their Python-based control strategy.
- **Automated Evaluation** – Submissions are tested in a cloud-based simulation environment.
- **Scoring System** – Algorithms are ranked based on predefined performance criteria.
- **Leaderboard** – Displays real-time rankings of competitors based on their scores.
- **Final Validation** – The winning algorithm is tested in ESA’s **Orbital Robotics Lab**.
